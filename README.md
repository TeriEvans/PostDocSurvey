# PostDoc Event Survey Results

The iPython notebook `Survey_Results.ipynb` contains the answers to each question. 
Results are plotted in R and all comments/suggestions are included in tables.

If you want to add something to this then clone the repository and run Jupyter Notebooks:

```
git clone https://github.com/TeriEvans/PostDocSurvey
cd PostDocSurvey/
Jupyter notebook
```
